# Manipulate-in-ROS2
This repository contains a simple ROS2 project that demonstrates how to manipulate the turtlesim package. The main objective is to control the turtle using custom ROS2 nodes and understand how to interact with topics, services, and parameters. All the steps are clearly documented here to help beginners get started with ROS2. The project includes launching the turtlesim node, writing a Python script to control the turtle’s movement, and running the script through ROS2 commands. You will find detailed instructions to build and run the package using colcon, as well as notes on setting up your ROS2 environment. This task was completed as part of a hands-on learning experience and is intended to guide others who are new to ROS2 development.
